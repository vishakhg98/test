<p>Hey, I can&#8217;t tell how deep I&#8217;m in. I mean,<br>I&#8217;ve been unmessing the mess I&#8217;ve been<br>But at times I feel like I&#8217;m in a dense green<br>Trekkin&#8217; within with no sense of direction</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, but why?&#8221; They ask. They always ask…because they don&#8217;t understand, I guess. It&#8217;s simple — we are all wired differently, and even with all worldly knowledge, wisdom does linger.</p>



<p>Depression and mental health are such ugly words for society. Perhaps, that&#8217;s also why people don&#8217;t discuss them as much as physical ailments. Or care for them unless a tragedy strikes. But, the truth of the matter is that our brain is a complex thing for us humans to comprehend, even when it&#8217;s our own. Also, it can be quite heavy, if not the heaviest thing on the planet.</p>



<p>So for those uninitiated who wonder, &#8220;Oh, but why?&#8221; Here&#8217;s an analogy — Depression can be like getting lost in a dense forest without GPS or compass. Like every other decision in life, you won&#8217;t even know when you veered off the trail. Once you do get lost, it&#8217;s like all your meticulous plans go for a toss.</p>



<p>You feel disoriented in the tangle of trees and bushes, wandering and cluelessly circling at one spot. It can be a dreadful and unsettling feeling to find yourself astray, cut off from the outside world.</p>



<p>Even if someone calls and guides you from the outside, you don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll make it. Your own creative brain plays its trickery, painting things grim than they probably are.</p>



<p>So don&#8217;t wander off into the wilderness as you don&#8217;t understand the depth of it. Your only recourse is to stay put. Share where you are and hopefully, somebody will come and get you. Until then just breathe, and look to the skies for a bigger picture.</p>

<p>To the boys,</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not about breasts n&#8217; vagina<br>Rather a bit of humanity huh<br>Show some decency not dicks duh<br>Who even wants to see that bruh?</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re out on midnight stroll<br>No one&#8217;s gonna rape your soul<br>Not the case if it&#8217;s a lady or doll<br>Even men get defiled by testosterone</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re working the same as her<br>Take the pay in the same dollar<br>With merit, if she leads, you follow<br>If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re stupid n&#8217; hollow</p>



<p>She cares for the man she likes<br>And it might not be you, yikes<br>Just let go of grudges n&#8217; gripes<br>You ain&#8217;t the Tarzan of the apes</p>



<p>Babes aren&#8217;t there to offer babies<br>It&#8217;s her choice to be a mommy<br>When she does, be a caring hubby<br>And a good daddy, that&#8217;s all matey</p>



<p>No he for she, in her space let her be<br>Breathin&#8217; free outta burka of society<br>Read her stories of Mary, Aisha n&#8217; Draupadi<br>Just not through the lens of patriarchy</p>



<p>Idk feminism<br>but I reckon its close to humanity<br>A realization of individuality and treating the other person as equally important life and not as a commodity.</p>



<p>Refer<br>Quran: verses 4:34 and 33:35<br>Bible: verses Galatians 3:28, Hosea 4:14<br>Manusmriti: Chapter 3, Verse 61, Chapter 9, Verses 2-4, 9-13, 18, 74</p>



<p>For ages in the books written by men, we read their interpretation which is somewhat like — God, created two sexes, both equal in his eyes.<br>But, now as we know, there are more sexual variations. And just like that maybe just maybe the interpretations were biased or incomplete or even inaccurate. Also, why God has to be a he?<br>Who knows, right?</p>

An ape shit not meant to exist<br />

His own mum won&#8217;t miss him a bit</p>
<p>Hey mom, you may insist killing is illicit<br />
But ill as it is, just like he didn&#8217;t resist<br />
I too did not desist instead I fixed it<br />
With my flaming fist and raging wrist</p>
<p>Hey mom, I rekt it n&#8217; the world won&#8217;t split<br />
cuz pure excuse for a man got his dick slit<br />
Hell I could just sit n&#8217; spit on his evil spirit<br />
Then forget it until you or my girl&#8217;s in the mix</p>
<p>Hey mom, but you know I couldn&#8217;t I wouldn&#8217;t<br />
I would end the world unto all life&#8217;s descend<br />
If something happened; so I&#8217;ll fight and fend<br />
Till my strong brethren&#8217;s weak minds mend</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shawty, it&#8217;s about a man in the making<br />
And a life that&#8217;s out there for his taking<br />
Chasing a story with gold and glory<br />
Holes and holy well to be less lonely<br />
Hoary, for he felt sorry for being whorey<br />
Fine me if you find these lines phony<br />
Honey, if you relate, great it&#8217;ll be thorny<br />
Or else spineless whine of a cornless corny</p>
<p>Wrote what I caught as my thoughts fought<br />
Wrought a lot, still, dot dot&#8230; dotless drought<br />
Naught nada nothing to note, nothing to gloat<br />
Gotta plot a lot to find just one spot for this GOAT<br />
Hot red-hot ramen in my head, stop I&#8217;m fuckin&#8217; fed<br />
Up with meeting my ends which ends up dead<br />
Heads up I&#8217;d rather be dead now than be another<br />
Subpar greyhead in deathbed weeping for the reaper</p>
<p>I admit I was in a vacuum within my darkroom<br />
Trying to seat my feet in others&#8217; shoes&#8217; no excuse<br />
And as I chose to cage my insecurities in a closet<br />
I was lost, locked in n&#8217; left with a loose neck noose<br />
But rose-tinted memories were all a lost cause needs<br />
At times when grasping at straws and flimsy reeds<br />
Held me together under the rain n&#8217; thunder&#8217;s reign<br />
Trusting the seeds I&#8217;d sown both in words n&#8217; deeds </p>
<p>Hey mister the world&#8217;s bloody sinister n&#8217; Imma sinner<br />
Err is to be me human who killed his way to the heaven<br />
I&#8217;m no angel nor lucifer crucified for the deadly seven<br />
But off the seven point seven billion, am I even a good one?<br />
Hmm hum this might sound like umm rant dumb<br />
Ho hum voice of people in drains, dregs n&#8217; dump<br />
Numb as they come from beyond the flattering filters<br />
Glitter n&#8217; glam, where hustle&#8217;s real, fun n&#8217; joy the fillers </p>
<p>So pull back n&#8217; peek a panic attack of a big blown crack<br />
Quack croak cry of a hunchback, out of his whack<br />
With a throat lump bigger than a boulder on his back<br />
Weighing on a heart that&#8217;s chronically homesick<br />
Click-clack boom thoughts like 9mm headshots fired<br />
And tired connecting dots shattered yet silly inspired<br />
By a few indistinct and distant dreams and desires<br />
Reaching &#8217;em is my sole resolve until this Life retires</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m waving goodbye to a past that passed by<br />
And the feet drift to a road less traveled by<br />
Although the eyes find them seemingly strayed<br />
But my heart says, &#8220;Leave it, let the way decide&#8221;<br />
So, this is a story of a man&#8217;s legacy in the making<br />
And about a life that&#8217;s out there for his taking<br />
See if you relate, great it&#8217;ll be a complex melody<br />
Else willy-nilly, it&#8217;ll come out as a confused medley</p>

Day in and day out, I&#8217;m on a ceaseless chase</p>
<p>Each day I wake up buried and broken<br />
Breathing for my one shot, one moment</p>
<p>In the cusp of darkness, as a new dawn stares<br />
With a greed for life, my fuckin&#8217; mind flares</p>
<p>I hear the wind rustle, rousing me to wrestle<br />
Hustle and bustle my way thru mindless muscles</p>
<p>I get off the bed half dead mind spread<br />
Still led in search for my everyday bread</p>
<p>Breath stuck like a stone in the throat<br />
Just gasping for my one shot, one moment</p>
<p>Thus I write, I erase, I write and I rephrase<br />
Day in and day out, I&#8217;m on a ceaseless chase</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To express endlessly exciting<br />
Dear words, he is inviting<br />
You to land in rhyming<br />
To etch a beauty in writing</p>
<p>I have held time by its throat<br />
You have the liberty you sought<br />
Have a taste of my thoughts<br />
Free my feelings laced in love knots</p>
<p>Ahead, thus the words marched headstrong<br />
To the home of my heart, they trailed along</p>
<p>Then they tried to stir the blur to confer<br />
What I prefer, what do I like about her?</p>
<p>I first echoed my favorite reply &#8220;I.D.K.&#8221;<br />
Then I said, if I may, if I had my way, I would say</p>
<p>She is tempting like the hook of a song<br />
Where melody and rhythm muse to belong</p>
<p>Her smile, breathtaking as the seamless skies<br />
It feels like a bliss that sailed across several lives</p>
<p>Her lips, soft and tender like red rose petals<br />
A kiss would feel like when the sun meets the sea and settles</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re close do gaze at her browny eyes<br />
You would see the space where a riddled star lies</p>
<p>A look of her simply slices my heart a little<br />
Crumbling my crimson heart, soft and brittle</p>
<p>Her hair falls on the elegant curves of her neck<br />
Via the valleys behind the seashell ears onto a speck</p>
<p>Yes a speck like the dark spot of the moon<br />
With a glow which would swoon in my rune </p>
<p>If only I had it my way, I will endlessly draw the &#8220;Endlessly Exciting Girl&#8221; with such distorted details. But words always vaporize and my memory isn&#8217;t loyal. I believe my words won&#8217;t fail me this time and I would immortalize a mortal forever in my words. </p>
<p>Thus, letters are landing and words are whipping into shape something special, something endlessly exciting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year began,</p>
<p>I was longing for the love I felt I lacked<br />
While mending a smile that was cracked<br />
Even the butterfly wings that fluttered<br />
In time, they too fell weak and withered</p>
<p>So I played along as a reclusive monk<br />
With eyes burrowed in a dark furrow<br />
I was torn between right and wrong<br />
Peace in pieces split in past and morrow</p>
<p>But then a day, I finally faced my crime<br />
Which pushed me back in my rhyme<br />
So now no more what-ifs, ifs, and buts<br />
Well, it is high time that I bust my butt<br />
I gotta rewrite my story outta this rut</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like the first drop from heaven, you fell<br />
You softly caressed and I fell in your spell</p>
<p>In a jiff, a whiff, a wind, I came into sense<br />
It felt like that moment mattered in all my tense</p>
<p>I let the world move ahead and simply stood<br />
Soaked, drenched and all my worries dripped</p>
<p>Ether showered upon me and I was wet again<br />
A cool dew drizzled down my brain and vein</p>
<p>It all felt blissful like every pure feeling should<br />
Would&#8217;ve locked up time in our bubble if I could</p>
<p>Yes, like the first drop from heaven, you fell<br />
You softly caressed and I simply fell in your spell</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ll feel the words choke up and bleed blue<br />
If for a while, you walk a mile in his shoes</p>
<p>In a crack amidst a world of little and more<br />
Life&#8217;s just day chores and nightly heartsore</p>
<p>As the lungs gasp till the end of my days<br />
His split mind will shatter in varied ways</p>
<p>My wicked heart will leave and stray<br />
While the dreamy reality resets like always</p>
<p>Yet we will be together when it ends<br />
To put a period to our ways and words</p>
<p>Buried as one in the valley of kings<br />
&#8216;It was all a dream&#8217;, our elegy sings</p>
<p>For him, about him, my antonym<br />
I&#8217;ll drop the eyes with no more disguise</p>
<p>In your flow, you wouldn&#8217;t know<br />
It&#8217;d been all for him, about him, my antonym</p>
