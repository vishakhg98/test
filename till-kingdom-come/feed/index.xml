					<description><![CDATA[Finally, nice to see somebody with a flair in writing
And this is no advertising!

Amazed I am at your talent
Times are tough and since you speak your thoughts and mind freely, I&#039;ll call you gallant!

Contents of your site are not that hocus pocus
Since understanding these needs some focus!

You truly are a linguaphile 
Since by reading these, I forget everything bad that has happened erstwhile!!


Hope that you&#039;ll forgive me for any mistakes which may have crept in while writing
As the very thoughts that these verses would be read by a linguaphile gets me into frighting!!]]></description>
