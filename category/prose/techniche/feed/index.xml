<p>In an interview, Jon Favreau, the director of Iron Man 1 and 2 said, &#8220;<em>Elon Musk makes no sense — and that’s the reason I know him. When I was trying to bring the character of genius billionaire Tony Stark to the big screen in Iron Man, I had no idea how to make him seem real and Robert Downey Jr. said that they need to sit down with Elon Musk</em>&#8220;.</p>
<figure id="attachment_813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-813" style="width: 697px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-813 size-full" src="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ironman.jpg" alt="Elon Musk, the Real Life Iron Man" width="697" height="361" srcset="./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ironman.jpg 697w, ./../../../../wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ironman-300x155.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-813" class="wp-caption-text">Elon Musk, the Real Life Iron Man</figcaption></figure>
<p>Robert Downey Jr., who plays Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, met Elon Musk in 2007. He considers Elon as a contemporary; someone Tony Stark would probably hang out with. He was awestruck by the SpaceX and Tesla infrastructure and facilities. After a personal tour with Musk, he said, &#8220;<em>My mind is not easily blown, but this place and this guy were amazing</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Both Musk and Stark were the types of men, according to Downey, who &#8220;<em>had seized an idea to live by and something to dedicate themselves to</em>&#8221; and they were not going to waste a moment.</p>

<p>Simply do a Google search of him and I&#8217;m sure it will blow your mind. He is the founder, CEO, and lead designer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX">SpaceX</a>;<sup id="cite_ref-SpaceX_10-0" class="reference"></sup> co-founder, CEO, and product architect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.">Tesla Inc.</a>;<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"></sup> co-founder and CEO of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink">Neuralink</a>; and co-founder of Paypal; co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI">OpenAI</a>; chairman of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarCity">SolarCity</a>; and founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boring_Company">The Boring company</a> (yeah that&#8217;s a real company). In December 2016, he was ranked 21st on the Forbes <i></i>list of The World&#8217;s Most Powerful People.<sup id="cite_ref-auto1_12-0" class="reference"></sup> As of October 2018, he has a net worth of $22.3 billion and is listed by <i>Forbes</i> as the 54th Richest Person in the World.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"></sup></p>
<p>Both Tesla and SpaceX are celebrated ventures now and are backed by public and investor support. But there was a time when neither the Wall street nor the social dogma validated the absurd ideas behind these companies. When you start something new, there will be people who give you negative feedback. Elon didn&#8217;t pay heed to them. Instead, he was persistent and took the helm to turn the tide. But how?</p>
<p>First of all, one thing that differentiates an ordinary person from an exceptional leader like Elon Musk is his vision. Turning humans into interplanetary species is his stated life&#8217;s purpose. These are not some absurd big words. His work on SpaceX, Tesla, and other futuristic enterprises prove that he is a man of action.</p>
<p>And this vision is not just about him but it has a worldview. For Elon, the only thing that makes sense to do is to strive for greater collective enlightenment. He likes to make technologies real that he thinks are important for the future and useful in some sort of way for the whole of mankind. Since it benefits all, people follow him.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.8px;">During the World Government Summit 2017, Elon said, &#8220;There need to be reasons to get up in the morning. There&#8217;s got to be things that people find inspiring and make life worth living&#8221;. Yes, he envisions to be part of something far deep and meaningful than the regular mundane life. And he is able to paint this picture for others to a point that they are hypnotized to believe in his vision.</span></p>
<p>For instance, Musk had set out to make an electric car without compromises. He did that. Then he upended the decades of criticisms against electric cars.</p>
<p>Even Larry Page, co-founder, and CEO of Google is a fan of the overarching vision of Musk. According to Page, &#8220;Good ideas are always crazy until they&#8217;re not. Solve cars, global warming, and make humans multi-planetary are compelling goals, and now Musk has businesses to do that.</p>
<p>This is a big reason why young geniuses from big-shot universities are eager to join his companies. When RDJ visited Tesla and SpaceX plants, he was impressed by the vigor and excitement of the employees. The workers at all of Musk&#8217;s companies are aware that they&#8217;re trying to achieve monumental things day in and day out, and it keeps them going. Musk wants to conquer the solar system, and, as it stands, there&#8217;s just one company where you can work if that sort of mission gets you out of the bed in the morning.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>I belive his quotes are enough to boost your morale. Here are some of my favorite quotes of him:</strong></p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.</li>
<li>The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.</li>
<li>I think it is possible for ordinary people to choose to be extraordinary.</li>
<li>Life is too short for long-term grudges.</li>
<li>Constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself. He calls it Feedback Loop</li>
<li>People should pursue what they&#8217;re passionate about. That will make them happier than pretty much anything else.</li>
<li>When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world.</li>
<li>Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.</li>
<li>Some people don’t like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster.</li>
<li>Really pay attention to negative feedback and solicit it, particularly from friends. … Hardly anyone does that, and it’s incredibly helpful.</li>
<li>No, Never! I don&#8217;t give up, I&#8217;d have to be dead or completely incapacitated.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a Tech Enthusiast, I patronize him and wish he achieves the milestones and beyond. For years, I&#8217;ve been following his contributions in the realm of technology. I wrote this article so that you also get to know about the most influential person in this century.</p>

<p><strong>My take on Smartphones and technology increasingly relying on AI for evolution.</strong></p>
<p>These days AI is the trending topic in tech. You see brands sticking this term to anything and everything. But AI isn&#8217;t something new. For instance, the Neural Network system was born in the 1940s. But, in recent years, every company and the media has hopped on to the AI bandwagon. If you haven&#8217;t heard or aren&#8217;t much up-to-date with the AI invasion in the mobile phone segment, no worries. Read further and explore the hottest thing in the tech realm.</p>
<p>As per a Gartner prediction, 80 percent of the smartphones would be AI-powered by the year 2022. It claims AI would be the product differentiator for smartphone vendors. After all, the smartphones ought to be smarter and AI is the best shot at that. You&#8217;ve been using AI mechanism in your phones by way of virtual assistants like SIRI and Google assistant, Prediction services in your phone keyboards, real-time translation, Facial recognition, photo enhancement, system optimization, chatbots, personalized news aggregators, etc. Still, these are premature renditions TBH! The era of IOT, edge computing, affective computing, 5G, and deep learning is at our doorsteps. So, these days all the tech giants are heavily investing in the AI department to improve the efficiency and user experience. Huawei&#8217;s made-for-AI Neural Processing Unit on their Kirin processor, Apple&#8217;s Bionic chip, Qualcomm&#8217;s Neural Processing SDK, etc are few of the leading examples.</p>
<p>The onboard AI chips in smartphones was a leap forward from cloud-based solution. This enables a better integration of AI into the smartphone apps. This facilitates improved latency, privacy, and less internet consumption as now data doesn&#8217;t have to be sent to the cloud servers for processing. But, it&#8217;s not all sunshine and rainbows. Like any new technology, this has a different set of problems. First of all, developers must incorporate the power of AI framework into their apps. In the present scenario, even the latest and greatest devices don&#8217;t have the system benchmarks to fully steer the AI horsepower. These neural engines are power hungry and would be heavy on system resources. And a major problem that impedes the implementation of AI is the dearth of training data as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence depends entirely on datasets. So, the R&#038;D cells of industry leaders are coming up with solutions to tackle the obstacles. Moreover, developers can utilize software libraries like Tensorflow to adapt and boost the potential of their apps.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m hyped for witnessing the technological advancements in this area. It won&#8217;t be a distant future when we will have smart devices on our palm or pocket that works in tandem to robots and other scientific marvels around us, all thanks to their mechanical brains. Till then let&#8217;s enjoy quicker shutter speeds, enhanced image processing, smart Duplex chat agent, intelligent Face ID, Auto-predictive text in the keyboard, search and mail, etc. Global market trends like GDPR would also contribute to this paradigm shift. I don&#8217;t find AI disruptive, instead, its like cherry on top for the already &#8220;smart&#8221; phones. I believe it would serve convenient and interesting applications for smartphone users. </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s your take on this age of AI and its implications on our day-to-day life? Kindly drop your comments on the same. I would love to read your spectrum of thoughts. </p>
